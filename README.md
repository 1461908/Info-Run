Our app is a 'running' game where the user will move their character left and right across the screen to avoid incoming DOM elements. 
Users will receive a time for how long they survived, and this score can be seen on a leaderboard.
we will implement features and variety to the game. Such as:

  One amazing player icon,
  
  A fun background and theme,
  
  endless obstacles of varying size and speed,
  
  uploading a username and score to a leaderboard
  
  

We expect our primary audience to be other info343 students. Perhaps friends and family members of informatics students. Otherwise our audience can be generalized to children and young adults.

The main features of our app will be:

  1.The game itself
  
  2.The leaderboard

  3.React-routing between various outer pages
  
  4.Installing with Webpack
  


Libraries we are definitely using:

  Firebase,
  
  React,
  
  Bootstrap,
  
  Phaser,

  React-Router,

  Webpack
