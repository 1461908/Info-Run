Our app is a 'running' game where the user will move their character left and right across the screen to avoid incoming DOM elements. 
Users will receive a time for how long they survived, and this score can be seen on a leaderboard.
Perhaps we will implement some user preferences and settings to add more features and variety to the game. Such as:

  customizing the player icon,
  
  changing the game background or theme,
  
  changing difficulty,
  
  sound effects?,
  
  more or less as necessary

We expect our primary audience to be other info343 students. Perhaps friends and family members of informatics students. Otherwise our audience can be generalized to children and young adults.

The main features of our app will be:

  1.The game itself
  
  2.The leaderboard
  
  3.User preferences
  
  4.Game settings

Libraries we are definitely using:

  Firebase,
  
  React,
  
  Bootstrap,
  
  Phaser
  
Libraries and APIs we might use:

  purgomalum (to filter inappropriateness),
  
  threejs,
  
  node?
